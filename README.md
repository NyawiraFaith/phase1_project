# Introduction
The key focus of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis to provide actionable insights to determine the best performing films at the Box Office. The insights obtained will be used to give recommendations for the upcoming studio in order to increase their chances for success.

# The Business Problem
Microsoft is interested in venturing into the film industry after noticing the success in the industry by setting up a new film studio. They however have no experience in producing successful films. In order to optimize their chances for success, they will need insights regarding the best performing films at the Box Office. With the results from the analysis, they will be well informed on what successful film production entails.

The insights will answer questions such as:

> What are the best performing genres in the Box Office?
> What studios are the biggest competition?
> Does a higher rating yield higher performance?
By translating these insights into practical recommendations, the new Microsoft studio will be better equipped to attain success in the competitive film industry.

# Objectives
The objectives are to analyze the data obtained from Box Office, create visualizations and to make recommendations on impactful strategies that should be implemented.

# Data Understanding
The data acqired for this analysis was extracted from:

movie_basics
movie_ratings
bom.movie_gross.csv.gz

# Data Preparation
In the data cleaning process I dropped missing values and removed duplicates. After that was the analysis to provide solutions to the problem statement.

# Conclusion
Adventure, Action and Sci-Fi genres have been consistent in generating the highest revenue, while horror based films perform poorer.

BV(Buena Vista) and Uni(Universal) studios are the leading competition in the film industry.

The relationship between ratings and performance is multi-layered, as some of the films with a lower rating still managed to attain substancial revenue suggesting secondary influence.

# Recommendations
Microsoft should focus on Adventure, Action and Sci-Fi films. They should also incorporate unique and compelling storylines for them to stand out.

Additionally, they should analyze the strategies the successful studios adopt and also look for opportunities to partner with them.

Lastly, since ratings alone do not ensure success, Microsoft should prioritize other strategies such as investing in a skilled marketing team. Other ways could be collaborating with social media influencers and working with well known actors/actresses .
